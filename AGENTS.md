# Agent Guide

This document is the **stable entry point** for AI coding agents (Codex and Claude
Code) working in `momens-server`. It holds durable project context and agent working
rules. Detailed or frequently changing project decisions live in other docs — start
here and explore outward via the "Documentation Map" section below.

Do not put confirmed-decision tables, dependency matrices, module lists, migration
plans, or other volatile project state in this file.

## Working Principles

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" -> "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" -> "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" -> "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```text
1. [Step] -> verify: [check]
2. [Step] -> verify: [check]
3. [Step] -> verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work")
require constant clarification.

## Current Phase

The repository is in the initial setup phase.

Do not start domain migration from the legacy Go/Gin `momens-api` yet. The
current goal is to establish the Spring project foundation: Gradle structure,
dependencies, CI, local development setup, and conventions.

For detailed setup decisions, read the relevant `docs/` pages instead of adding them
here.

## Repository Roles In The Wider System

| Repository | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `teams` | Product requirements, ADRs, glossary, product language |
| `momens-api` | Legacy Go/Gin user-facing API to be replaced |
| `momens-server` | New Java Spring product API server |
| `momens-worker` | External source ingestion and curation worker |
| `momens-retrieval` | Java Spring retrieval read-model server |
| `k8s` | Kubernetes and infrastructure definitions |

## Architecture Intent

`momens-server` should be one deployable Spring Boot API application. It should
use Gradle multi-module boundaries and Spring Modulith verification to keep
internal modules explicit.

Do not split into microservices during initial setup.

Do not create domain implementation before the project foundation is stable.

Detailed architecture rules live in `docs/rules/architecture.md`.

## Working Rules

- Do not invent dependencies. Add only dependencies confirmed in docs or by the user.
- Do not infer unsettled decisions. If a rule is not settled, log it in
  `docs/pending-decisions.md` and confirm with the team.
- Do not commit `.env`, `.idea`, `*.iml`, real secrets, or local-only config.
- Do not use private submodules or private repositories as secret stores.
- Keep this file and other agent-only guidance in English.
- Prefer updating shared human-facing docs under `docs/` in Korean; AI agents also
  read those docs, but there is no separate AI documentation tree.

## Documentation Map

This file (`AGENTS.md`) is the single source of truth for agent guidance and is read by
both Codex and Claude Code. `CLAUDE.md` is a one-line pointer (`@AGENTS.md`) — do not
duplicate content there.

Start here:

- `README.md` — repository purpose and current scope
- `docs/README.md` — documentation index
- `docs/onboarding.md` — setup and day-to-day workflow
- `docs/pending-decisions.md` — open decisions; do not infer these

Topic-specific docs:

- `docs/rules/` — standing project-wide rules
- `docs/rules/architecture.md` — modular modulith and package direction
- `docs/rules/git.md` — branch, commit, PR, and merge rules
- `docs/rules/code-conventions.md` — coding style, Spring, DTO, logging, tests
- `docs/rules/persistence.md` — DB, JPA, Flyway, time, identifiers
- `docs/rules/configuration.md` — configuration and secrets
- `docs/rules/observability.md` — metrics, traces, logs, correlation IDs
- `docs/spec/` — server API contracts
- `docs/adr/` — ADR process and exceptional decision records
- `docs/design/` — evolving detailed design, added when needed
